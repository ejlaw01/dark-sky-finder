# Dark-sky-finder

Dark Sky Finder is a program that helps users plan a stargazing outing.  It includes an interactive Google Map with an overlay of a map of light pollution, which is ambient light emanating from cities that brightens the sky and obscures the stars.  It also includes a weather API so that users can check the weather at the location they wish to view the sky from.
